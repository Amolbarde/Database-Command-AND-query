TCL ( transaction control language)
- use to manage transaction in database 

first start transaction
--> start transaction 

1) commit(when Execute update query and write commit then the changes is  permenently save in database)

--> delete from emp where id=1;
--> commit 

2) rollback( when Execute update query and write rollback then the changes is  not save in database)

--> update emp set id=2 where id=3;
--> rollback;
(then the emp not update)

3)savepoint(A SAVEPOINT is a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back, without rolling back the entire transaction.)

-->CREATE TABLE Bank (
    AccNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Balance DECIMAL(10,2)
);

Start a transaction
--> START TRANSACTION


🧿Step 1: Insert record

--> INSERT INTO Bank VALUES (1, 'Akshay', 5000)

🧿Step 2: Set a savepoint
--> SAVEPOINT step1;

🧿Step 3: Insert another
--> INSERT INTO Bank VALUES (2, 'Rahul', 7000);

🧿Step 4: Set another savepoint
--> SAVEPOINT step2;

🧿Step 5: Insert wrong data
-->INSERT INTO Bank VALUES (3, 'Amit', -2000); -- wrong balance

step 5 is wrong ❌.
So, rollback only to step2, not the entire transaction:

--> ROLLBACK TO step2;

👉 This removes Amit’s record, but keeps Akshay & Rahul’s records.

🧿Step 6: finnally commit 
-->commit;
